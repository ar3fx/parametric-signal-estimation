# Parametric Signal Estimation Using the Cumulative Distribution Transform
This repository contains the MATLAB implementation of the cumulative distribution transform (CDT) based estimation techniques proposed in the paper, "Parametric Signal Estimation Using the Cumulative Distribution Transform".
Couple examples in python using PyTransKit (Python Transport Based Signal Processing Toolkit) package is also available in: https://github.com/rohdelab/PyTransKit/tree/master/Examples
